- [ ] Idk how do you want the calendar to be implemented in the database
    - [ ] Upon adding tasks in the calendar.. append it to the firestore database
    - [ ] Modify the Home Page to fetch the tasks from the firestore database
- [x] Add the graph and resize it so it fits the container in the homePage
- [ ] Further Validation in the Signup page.. In the application scope not firebase scope..

- [ ] Integrate firestore with the routines page
    - [ ] Double check the firestore_controller and modify the collection (database table) to your liking
    - [ ] Currently.. the database is only affected by "adding" an activity.. Handle the following:
        - [ ] Checking an activity (updating "isDone" field in the collection)
        - [ ] Deleting an activity (deleting the document from the user's routine collection - Each document represents one task)
- [ ] Integrate firestore with the goals page
