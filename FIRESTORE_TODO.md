- [ ] Idk how do you want the calendar to be implemented in the database
    - Modify the Home Page to fetch the tasks from the database
- [ ] Add the graph and resize it so it fits the container in the homePage
- [ ] Further Validation in the Signup page.. In the application scope not firebase scope..

## Amr
- [ ] Implement features in the settings page, Start with Account Management!
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Google Sign in
- [ ] Idk what else

## Yahya
- [ ] Integrate firestore with the routines page
    - [ ] Double check the firestore_controller and modify the collection (database table) to your liking
    - [ ] Currently.. the database is only affected by "adding" an activity.. Handle the following:
        - [ ] Checking an activity (updating "isDone" field in the collection)
        - [ ] Deleting an activity (deleting the document from the user's routine collection - Each document represents one task)
- [ ] Integrate firestore with the goals page
